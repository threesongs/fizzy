class Ai::ListCommentsTool < Ai::Tool
  description <<-MD
    Lists all comments accessible by the current user.
    The response is paginated so you may need to iterate through multiple pages to get the full list.
    URLs are valid if they are just a path - don't change them!
    Each comment object has the following fields:
    - id [Integer, not null]
    - card_id [Integer, not null]
    - body [String, not null]
    - created_at [String, not null] ISO8601 formatted timestamp
    - creator [Object, not null] the User that created the comment
    - system [Boolean, not null] indicates if the comment was created by the system
    - reactions [Array]
      - content [String, not null]
      - reacter [Object] represents a User
        - id [Integer, not null]
        - name [String, not null]
